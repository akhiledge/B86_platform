My name is Sachu George. I was born in a beautiful village called Kalkundu situated
in Malappuram district of Kerala. My father is a farmer and mother is a house wife.
In my childhood I used to help my father in agriculture, play football with my friends
and enjoy swimming in the nearby river.
My parents are my motivators and models in life. They believed me completely in
whatever I did. They were the people who made me aware of the importance of
education. It was their motivation which kick-start the dream of becoming an
engineer in my life. Till th standard I studied in the nearby school. In th standard
board exam I got less marks in maths which at that point put me down. But soon I
overcome it by improving the subject and joined engineering which was one of my
greatest dream.
I joined in SJCET Engineering College in Palai which is about km away from my
home. As my family faced financial problems, I had taken bank loan during my
engineering. This made me more responsible, hardworking and enthusiastic in
completing my studies. College and hostel life had also improved my social and
mental abilities.
I always wished to work in a company which is related with my course of study. This
made me decide to join for embedded programming course in Bangalore after
engineering. From there I was selected by our company Global Edge Software
Limited. Here I wish to do my job efficiently and sincerely and to make my parents
proud. I also have my short term goal as to repay my bank loan on my own.
In the years of my life I would like to thank God, parents and my well wishers
who helped me a lot for strengthening me and building a career.
Sachu George
